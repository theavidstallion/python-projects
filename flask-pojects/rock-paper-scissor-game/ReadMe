This projects is based on simple game of rock, paper, scissor. The rock defeats the scissor, the scissor defeats the rock, and
the paper defeats the rock.
In the Flask powered interface that will be run on browser, the server will take an input from the user of their choice and will give
the result accordingly.
The server chooses a play randomly with use of 'random' library module.
It keeps track of total wins/losses of server and user for an instance of the program.
The webpages look elegant with proper use of HTML and CSS.

To run it, you need to install Flask and Python on your PC. Then initiate Flask from terminal with the 'python app.py',
It will give a local host IP address, use that to access the webpage and play the game.

The files directory must be like this:

app.py
templates
  index.html
  result.html
static
  styles.css
